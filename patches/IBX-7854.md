```
Create new content with a 'ezform' field

click 'edit' on the Form (ezform) to open Form Builder modal
add email field
add text field
add button field
Click Save
Click Send for publish
Re-edit the content

click 'edit' on the Form (ezform) to open Form Builder modal
click the 'gear' on the 'button'
Select 'redirect to content item
open the choose and pick any content item
click the 'Save' at the bottom of the fly out
BUG: it will not save! it just refreshes over and over
I repeated this on 2 installs
WORKAROUND:

click the 'Gear' on the Button input field
select 'Thank you text' and put some junk data
click 'Save' and it will indeed save
click the 'Gear' on the Button input field (again)
NOW you can select 'Redirect to content Item'
choose a content item
and click 'Save' and it will indeed save the redirect.
But without this extract step there is no way to save the Button input field
